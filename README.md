Logiscool Mons Intranet ‚Äì Version 3

The third version of the Logiscool Mons intranet, lmi-v3 is a complete rewrite of the previous CRM system, designed for easier deployment, maintainability, and scalability.

Developed with Express and React (TypeScript), this version modernizes the entire platform while preserving and improving the key operational features that support the daily management of Logiscool Mons, a programming school for children and teenagers.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features and Operations

Student attendance tracking

Performance statistics and dropout monitoring

Financial dashboard and revenue tracking for teachers

Administrative and management tools

Easy database synchronization via Excel imports/exports

These features help automate many of the school‚Äôs recurring administrative tasks, giving staff better visibility, control, and efficiency in daily operations.

# üß© From LMI2 to LMI3

The previous version, LMI2, was built within an Office 365 environment, leveraging SharePoint, Power Automate, and Power Apps.
Despite the constraints of that ecosystem, it successfully delivered all the core functionalities of the intranet.

In 2025, LMI2 notably helped students recover missed lessons more than 160 times, showcasing the real operational impact of the system on both staff and learners.

With LMI3, the goal is to move beyond the limitations of the Office 365 ecosystem, offering a dedicated, independent web application that‚Äôs easier to deploy, extend, and maintain ‚Äî all while keeping the same mission of simplifying school management.
